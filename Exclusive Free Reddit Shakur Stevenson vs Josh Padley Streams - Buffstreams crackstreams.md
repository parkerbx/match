Stevenson (22-0) is already a three-division champion at 27. The Newark native won gold at featherweight and super featherweight before picking up the vacant WBC lightweight crown against Edwin De Los Santos. Headlining a show in Newark, he won in a tentative performance against Artem Harutyunyan.

Schofield had been due to challenge fellow undefeated American Stevenson for the WBC lightweight world title he has held since outpointing Edwin De Los Santos in November 2023 before retaining it against Artem Harutyunyan in New Jersey last summer.

However, Golden Boy fighter Schofield was taken ill earlier this week and hospitalised for a period before being discharged and deemed unable to fight by the British Boxing Board of Control (BBBoC).

Promoters scrambled to find a quick replacement at just four days’ notice to keep Stevenson on the bill, with the ultra-talented three-weight world champion having been scheduled to defend his belt against Wales’ two-time former super-featherweight champion Joe Cordina on the undercard of the first Artur Beterbiev-Dmitry Bivol undisputed fight card back in October, only for the bout - the first on his new Matchroom deal - to be cancelled after he suffered a hand injury in training that required surgery.

Leaving Top Rank, Stevenson is looking for a fresh start. The 2016 Olympic silver medalist is ready to prove those who doubt his skills wrong by putting on a clinic against Padley.

Stevenson was supposed to fight Schofield (18-0), who backed out after being hospitalized due to a mysterious illness. The latter didn't appear at any pre-fight events in Saudi Arabia, and his father accused Stevenson's team of poisoning him.

But Padley will know that Saturday night’s challenge is on another level altogether as he faces an unbeaten superstar southpaw who has won world titles at featherweight, super-featherweight and lightweight en route to amassing a 22-0 professional record with 10 knockouts after winning a silver medal at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.

A staple of most people’s pound-for-pound list of the best active fighters in recent years, Stevenson will be a massive odds-on favourite to comfortably take care of business against Padley and move on to larger challenges.

There looked to be a healthy respect between both men in the build-up to fight night, though tempers frayed a little during an eventful weigh-in as each came in around the 134lb mark and a little pushing and shoving ensued as they jostled for the limelight in front of the cameras.

Padley (15-0) competes in his first world title fight. The Doncaster-born fighter scored an upset win against Mark Chamberlain in September and is ranked twelfth by the WBC.

Matchroom’s Padley is an unbeaten 15-0 fighter (with four knockouts) hailing from the village of Armthorpe in Doncaster in South Yorkshire, who alongside his boxing career also works as an electrician.

The controversial claim has seen Stevenson be at the centre of wild allegations of apparently food poisoning and spying on his rival.

Since moving up weight classes two years ago, Stevenson has shown his dominance after winning and defending the WBC World Lightweight title.

He is also the former WBC and WBO World Featherweight champion and now faces Josh Padley on short notice in a fight he is expected to win comfortably.

But Padley will know that Saturday night’s challenge is on another level altogether as he faces an unbeaten superstar southpaw who has won world titles at featherweight, super-featherweight and lightweight en route to amassing a 22-0 professional record with 10 knockouts after winning a silver medal at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
