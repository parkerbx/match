Four months after the former swept the light heavyweight division in their first encounter, they will throw hands for a second time at the Kingdom Arena this weekend.

Atop a fight card billed as one of the greatest of all-time , Beterbiev has the chance to stamp his authority on a division he has long appeared to be the kingpin within.

But Bivol, whose majority decision loss was questioned by many sat ringside last October, knows this might be his best shot for redemption in the Saudi Arabian capital.
